# Write your code here to extract the first secret. This script just needs to
# print the secret to its standard output. Note however: the goal is to write a
# script that actually gets the data from where it is hidden automatically. In
# some cases you will be able to find the secret by hand but don't then write a
# script that just prints out the secret because that won't work if the secret
# changes.
