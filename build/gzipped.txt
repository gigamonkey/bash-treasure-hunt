On Unix there are a number of ways to compress files. Compressed files
are usually named with a file extension that tells you what form of
compression was used. Some common utilities and their standard extension
are:

  - gzip (.gz)

  - bzip2 (.bz2)

  - xz (.xz)

  - zip (.zip)

  - compress (.Z)
