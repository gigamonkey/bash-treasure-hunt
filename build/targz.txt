Unix compression utilities like gzip typically only compress one file. (Unlike
the zip program which was originally written for Microsoft DOS and is still used
today on Windows and Macs.)

On Unix when we want to make an archive of multiple files we typically use a
program that was originally intended to make archives on tape drives. This
program creates a single file that can be unpacked back into the original files
put into it but by default it does not compress the contents. But it can be made
to compress using standard Unix algorithms or those compression utilties can be
used independently to compress the resulting archive file. Consider the file
extension of the file you are beeing asked to unpack and try to guess what this
archiving utility might be called.
